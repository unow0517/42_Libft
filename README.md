# Libft
Library of Functions. It will be used in most of projects in 42 Curriculum.

# Must Know
* solid knowledge in pointer in c is required.
* memory allocation in c.
* struct, linked list in c.

# Key Point
* take edge cases into consideration when implementing a function, you can check the edge cases  with [Francinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette) for each function.
* Unlike other easy-to-use programming language like Python, Users should build the functions they need or use library.
* Is C low-level programming language?

*A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architectureâ€”commands or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language. [^1]*
<br/>

*The terms high-level and low-level are inherently relative. Some decades ago,[timeframe?] the C language, and similar languages, were most often considered "high-level", as it supported concepts such as expression evaluation, parameterised recursive functions, and data types and structures, while assembly language was considered "low-level". **Today, many programmers might refer to C as low-level, as it lacks a large runtime-system (no garbage collection, etc.), basically supports only scalar operations, and provides direct memory addressing;** it therefore, readily blends with assembly language and the machine level of CPUs and microcontrollers. Also, in the introduction chapter of The C Programming Language (second edition) by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, C is described as "not a very high level" language. [^2]*

# How To Use
1. `git clone https://github.com/unow0517/42_libft.git`
2. `cd 42_Libft`
3. `make`

if you want to use functions in Libft, copy '42_Libft' Folder in the project and compile together.
